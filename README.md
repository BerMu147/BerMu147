ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Berin Mujcinovic

I am 26 years old Software Developer & DevOps Engineer. Currently living in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I'm investing my time in DevOps operations because it's the most interesting branch for me and I am ready to accept and work on unexpected challenges.

In my free time, as a hobby I am working on music production in FL Studio. You can check my work on my personal [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/berin-muj-inovi) profile
